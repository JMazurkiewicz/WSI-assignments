# Assignment 2

Goal: implement evolutionary algorithm.

Score: **6/7**

## About

The goal of the project is to find optimal usage of fuel for rocket flight described in `src/rocket_flight.py`.

## How to run

```bash
python main.py <prob_1> <pop_size> <crossover_prob> <mut_prob> <iter_limit>
```

* `prob_1` - probability of `1` in members of initial population
* `pop_size` - initial population size
* `crossover_prob` - probability of crossover
* `mut_prob` - probability of mutation
* `iter_limit` - iteration limit
