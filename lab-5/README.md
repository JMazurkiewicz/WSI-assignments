# Assignment 5

## Goal

Goal: implement multilayer perceptron and chosen gradient optimization algorithm

## About

Program `main.py` trains neural network with images of hand-written digits from MNIST set.

## How to run

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extra programs

Programs `mnist8.py` and `mnist28.py` print digits from MNIST set to the terminal:

```bash
python mnist8.py [image-index]
python mnist28.py [image-index]
```

Default value of `[image-index]` is 0.
